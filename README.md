## Overview

Snow Removal Pro leverages cutting-edge **SnowCore AI**, **quantum snow detection**, and **thermal displacement vectors** to deliver an unparalleled snow removal consultation experience.

**Does it remove snow?** No.

**Does it make you feel like someone cares about your snow problem?** Briefly.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm start
# Output: "Yeah Charles, you're on your own weeny."
```

## Available Scripts

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Delivers the hard truth |
| `npm run remove-snow` | Initializes quantum snow detection (not really) |
| `npm run forecast` | 100% chance you're still shoveling |

## Claude Code Integration

This repo includes a Claude Code slash command for the full interactive experience.

### Setup

Copy `.claude/commands/removesnow.md` into your project's `.claude/commands/` directory.

### Usage

In Claude Code, type:

```
/removesnow
```

You'll be taken through a **very serious** enterprise snow removal consultation:

1. **Snow Depth Assessment** — How many inches? (Options range from "Standard Protocol Alpha" to "DEFCON SNOW")
2. **Property Classification** — Is this a "pedestrian mobility corridor" or an "enterprise-scale snow operation"?
3. **Area Estimation** — Calibrating the snow-affected zone
4. **The Verdict** — ...yeah, you're on your own.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Actually remove snow
- [ ] Integrate with weather API (to tell you it's going to snow again tomorrow)
- [ ] Add blockchain-based snow tracking
- [ ] AI-powered shovel recommendation engine
- [ ] Uber for snow removal (just kidding, that exists)

## FAQ

**Q: Does this actually do anything?**
A: It delivers emotional closure.

**Q: Why does it exist?**
A: Because it's snowing in New Jersey and Charles needed to cope.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Sure, but the snow isn't going to shovel itself while you're writing PRs.
